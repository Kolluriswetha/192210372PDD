        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app activity such as features used, screens visited, language settings, and story generation history.</li>
        <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> device model, operating system version, IP address, crash logs, and app version for diagnostic purposes.</li>

      <p>We use collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide, operate, maintain, and improve the App and its features (including story generation).</li>
        <li>Process account registration and authentication, and to communicate with you about your account.</li>
        <li>Personalize your experience (e.g., remembering favorite genres, font settings, and story history).</li>

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services for us (hosting, analytics, crash reporting, email delivery). These providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> if required by law, regulation, or legal process, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
        <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> if the App is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction (we will notify you where required by law).</li>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> when you ask us to share or publish content (for example, if you choose to share a story publicly).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Third-Party Services &amp; Links</h2>
      <p>Magic Words may use third-party services such as analytics providers, crash-reporting tools, and cloud hosting. These services collect and process data according to their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of those third parties. The App may contain links to third-party websites; we are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Analytics and Cookies</h2>
      <p>We may use analytics services to understand how users interact with Magic Words. Analytics help us improve the App’s performance and user experience. We do not use cookies in the traditional browser sense for the native Android app, but we may store small data on the device (local storage) to remember settings and preferences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. How We Store and Secure Your Data</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information. This includes encryption in transit (HTTPS) and other access controls. However, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security of data. If a data breach occurs that affects your information, we will comply with applicable laws and notify you as required.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, or as required by law. You may delete your account to remove your profile and associated data — see section 10 for your rights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Magic Words is not intended for children under 13 (or higher age if required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the applicable minimum age. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>
